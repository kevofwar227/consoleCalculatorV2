# consoleCalculatorV2
I explored other languages and needed a refresh. I've decided to use c# as my main language from now on.

Change Log:
It still preforms normal basic arithmatic operations but it has a nicer UI. It is also written fairly cleaner and simpler. 

What to expect with next project:
I will work on a GUI interface calculator for v3
ideally I will be able to create other windows apps with c# other than calculators, but I cant deny their use for learning a language.
